# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahnaf — AI, Robotics & Automation Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I specialize in building **intelligent systems** that scale — from AI miners on decentralized networks to hands-on robotics and drone applications in the classroom. My work sits at the intersection of **AI, automation, and education**.

## 🧠 AI & Decentralized Systems

Currently building and optimizing miners on cutting-edge AI networks like **Bittensor**, **Gensyn**, and **MetaHash**:

- 🛰️ **AI Factory (SN80)** — Qwen/DeepSeek-based scientific generation miner
- 🔐 **Merit (SN73)** — Evaluating reputation via hash-based scoring
- 🧠 **Neural Condense (SN27)** — High-throughput inference using CUDA
- 🎶 **SoundsRight** — Audio classification & generation with local models
- ⚡ **Polaris / LogicNet / TPN / RL-Swarm** — Real-time LLM miners using PM2, Docker, and WireGuard
- 🧪 Deploying **local LLMs** (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek) via OpenAI-compatible APIs

## 🤖 Robotics, Drones & AI Education

With **2+ years as a VEX IQ Robotics Instructor**, I’ve taught dozens of students and led teams to multiple victories.

- 🏆 **2x VEX IQ champion mentor**
- 🔧 Built & taught with **Clawbot IQ, Armbot, Autopilot, Ike**
- ✈️ Developed basic **drone navigation projects** using Python & microcontrollers
- 📚 Designed STEM + AI curriculum (Python, C++, logic circuits, sensors)
- 🎓 Delivered workshops on robotics + AI integration for K–12 students
