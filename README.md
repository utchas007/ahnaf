## 🧠 AI & Decentralized Systems

Currently building and optimizing miners on cutting-edge AI networks like **Bittensor**, **Gensyn**, and **MetaHash**:

- 🛰️ **AI Factory (SN80)** — Qwen/DeepSeek-based scientific generation miner
- 🔐 **Merit (SN73)** — Evaluating reputation via hash-based scoring
- 🧠 **Neural Condense (SN27)** — High-throughput inference using CUDA
- 🎶 **SoundsRight** — Audio classification & generation with local models
- ⚡ **Polaris / LogicNet / TPN / RL-Swarm** — Real-time LLM miners using PM2, Docker, and WireGuard
- 🧪 Deploying **local LLMs** (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek) via OpenAI-compatible APIs
